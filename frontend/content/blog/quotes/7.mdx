## The illusion of control

you need to forget about what you know,\
hitting bottom is not a fucking weekend retreat\
its not a god damn seminenar.\
Stop trying to control everything and just let go.\
`fight club @1:38:42`


In pursuit of knowledge,
every day something is added.\
In the practice of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.\
Less and less do you need to force things,
until finally you arrive at non-action.\
When nothing is done,
nothing is left undone.

True mastery can be gained
by letting things go their own way.\
It can't be gained by interfering.
