## Memento Mori

To begin depriving death of it's greatest advantage over us, let us adopt a way clean contrary to that of the common one; let us deprive death of it's strageness, let us frequent it, let us get used to it; let us have nothing more often in mind than death. We do not know where death await us: so let us wait for it everywhere. To practice death is to practice freedom. A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.\
`michel de montaigne`

`mozart`

There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest — whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories — comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.\
`albert camus`

Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back\
`marcus aurelius`

to face the fact that you are completely alone and to accept that you are alone is to accept death\
