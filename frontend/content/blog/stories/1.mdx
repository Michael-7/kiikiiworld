That little scratch on the roof of your mouth, That would heal only if you stopped tounging it, but you can't. 

That feeling that something must be wrong, something must be missing. The feeling that somehow you never really fit in, you kinda did at some point, but not really. 

That thought that says "Is this it? Is this really all there is to life? There must be more. Right?"

And then .. you finally reach that goal, the one that's supposed to fix you, to scratch that itch, to fill that feeling, to make your life whole... And what do you get.. nothing, you feel nothing, there is nothing, and that hole within you just became a whole lot fuckin bigger. And not only the roof of your mouth is itching now but it began to spread to your ear too.

---

You find a new pursuit, maybe one more spiritually oriented, double down your efforts. All in. this must be it, this must be the key. This time you're open to a little more radical stuff, maybe aliens, maybe god, maybe the universe is shifting to the 5th dimension, maybe buddhism or something eastern, eastern stuff is always good. Whatever could fix it.. you use.

If you're lucky.. this is enough distraction.. so you don't notice the itch anymore. If you don't notice the itch well ha! Then there is no itch. Problem solved, hole covered, thought parried, crisis averted.

Now you are made whole, a reborn christian, a spiritually attuned person, a self-development junkie, a member of heavens gate. You have found a herd, you are connected.

BUT

If you're lucky, this wont stop the itch. It might work for a little while but once the initial newness wears off.. your mind is less occupied, its starts to wonder, the itch returns, it quickly spreads again, this time not only to your ear, this time its your nose too. Probably your ego starts acting up. You start to develop anxiety,, the kickback of your mind being overly active trying to obscure the hole within. Your eyes start itching, you begin to see the sheer pointlessness of everything. Anxiety and futility.. now we have a reasonable depression on our hands.

No you have two options:
1. Turn this reasonable depression into a major one.
2. Medicate, however you want, pills, meditation, a psychologist, find a support group. Try to mindfuck yourself into thinking life is flowery again. Ride some upwards spiral. slowly go down again. idek keep swimming, keep your head above water. Do whatever you can, don't stop moving or you'll sink. Maybe now join Heavens Gate?

---

Or just stop. let yourself sink. Yes maybe life is pointless, yes maybe your self is all lies, maybe the dark hole is pitch black and maybe your relationships can never be more than superficial bonding over traits that the self created and are completely made up. You know you are useless piece of shit. You know you're a imposter. A fucking lie.

The more you resist the process the harder it is, let your self go

Maybe you don't have to hold your breath and struggle, maybe you can open your mouth and breath underwater, maybe it's okay and the only thing telling you that it's not okay is that stupid self. that thinks it needs all these things. that thinks itself valid. Maybe being a piece of shit is okay cuz everybody is a piece of shit. Maybe there is something on the other side of that black hole. Maybe less is more and maybe just maybe, total pointlessness is actually total freedom.

*idk man thats a trip*
